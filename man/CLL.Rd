\title{Expression data from healthy and malignant (chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
CLL) human B-lymphocytes after B-cell receptor stimulation (GSE 39411
dataset)}

\description{
B-cells were negatively selected from healthy donors and previously
untreated CLL patients. BCR stimulated and unstimulated control B-cells were
treated at four time points after stimulation for total RNA extraction and
hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

\details{
The dataset provided with package is the first five lines of the full
dataset. The full dataset can be downloaded from the github repository of
the package
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbertran/Patterns/master/add_data/CLL.RData).

Three different cell populations (6 healthy B-lymphocytes, 6 leukemic CLL
B-lymphocyte of indolent form and 5 leukemic CLL B-lymphocyte of aggressive
form) were stimulated in vitro with an anti-IgM antibody, activating the
B-cell receptor (BCR). We analyzed the gene expression at 4 time points (60,
90, 210 and 390 minutes). Each gene expression measurement is performed both
in stimulated cells and in control unstimulated cells. For one aggressive
CLL case, we silenced expression of DUSP1 by transfecting DUSP1-specific
RNAi and, as a control, transfected cells with a non-targeting RNAi. We then
stimulated the BCR of these cells and analyzed the gene expression at the
same time points in stimulated cells and in control unstimulated cells.
